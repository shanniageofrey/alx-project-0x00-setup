# alx-project-0x00-setup

- This is a Next.js-based project designed to teach the fundamentals of building modern web applications using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. The application mimics core features of Airbnbâ€™s UI, including property listings with images, ratings, and interactive components, while emphasizing best practices in front-end development.

## Learning Objectives
- By completing this project, you will:
  * Understand how to scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript
  * Learn Next.js folder structure and organization best practices
  * Implement basic routing in Next.js (Pages Router)
  * Create reusable React components with TypeScript
  * Work with TypeScript interfaces for component props
  * Manage assets and static files in Next.js
  * Develop an understanding of component composition
  * Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  * Set up and configure ESLint for code quality

## Requirements
  * Node.js (v16 or later)
  * npm or yarn
  * Visual Studio Code (or any preferred IDE)
  * Next.js v13+
  * TypeScript
  * Tailwind CSS
  * ESLint

## Best Practices
### Project Structure:
  * Components are organized in a dedicated components directory
  * TypeScript interfaces are centralized in an interfaces directory
  * Pages follow Next.js convention in the pages directory

### Component Design:
  * Components are typed with TypeScript interfaces
  * Reusable components accept props for customization
  * Components are modular and focused on single responsibilities

### Code Quality:
  * ESLint is configured for code consistency
  * TypeScript provides type safety
  * Arrow function syntax is used consistently

### Styling:
  * Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling
  * Responsive design principles are applied
  * Consistent spacing and typography scales

### Performance:
  * Next.js Image component is used for optimized images
  * Code splitting is handled automatically by Next.js
  * Only necessary dependencies are included
